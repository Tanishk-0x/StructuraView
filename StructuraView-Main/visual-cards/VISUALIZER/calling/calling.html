        <p id="para"><span id="head">Function Calling in Programming : </span>Function Calling in programming refers to the process of invoking or executing a function within a program. Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task, and they allow programmers to organize their code into reusable units, making it easier to manage and maintain.</p>

        <p id="para1"><span id="head">What is Function Calling?</span>Function Calling involves specifying the function’s name followed by parentheses(). If the function requires input values, known as parameters, then they are passed inside the parentheses as arguments. When the function is called, the program execution jumps to the function’s code block, executes it, and then returns control to the point in the program where the function was called.</p>

                    <p id="text">In C++ programming we have different ways to pass arguments to functions mainly by Call by Value and Call by Reference method. These two methods differ by the types of values passed through them as parameters.

                                             
                        The actual parameters also known as arguments are the parameters that are passed into the function when we make a function call whereas formal parameters are the parameters that we see in the function or method definition i.e. the parameters received by the function.</p>
